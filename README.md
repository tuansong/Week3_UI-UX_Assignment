# The comparation about some airline websites :rocket:
Commonly, all airline landing are focus on the booking section at the first look on page, then the promotion section as the banner of the page\
All pages have different palette color

## 1. [VietNam Airline](https://www.vietnamairlines.com/)
UI:Simple and well organize
UX:
- Booking section shows up by clicking, user can focus on it easier
- Destination menu displays list of country with related region, it helps visitor alot to find location
- 
## 2. [VietJet](https://www.vietjetair.com/Sites/Web/vi-VN/Home)
UI: I think they need to refactor their website LOL
UX: 
- Kidda messy, A visitor dont know where to focus on this page
- I think they might attend on promotions than another things because they're low-cost airline
## 3. [Jetstar](https://www.jetstar.com/vn/en/home)
UI: Like Vietjet they're low-cost airline but more organized with promotion banner
UX:
- I dont like the static carousel
The dropdown menu on arrival and departure field is too big 
## 4. [Singaporean Airline](http://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/vn/home)
3rd banner has low quality image
UX:
Automatically get the origin destination for customer, it's really helpful
## 5. [Emirates](https://www.emirates.com/vn/english/)
UI
UX:
