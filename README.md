# The comparation about some airline websites :rocket:
> Commonly, all airline landing pages are focus on the booking section at the first look on page, then the promotion section as the banner of the page\
> All pages have different palette with different style.

## 1. [VietNam Airline](https://www.vietnamairlines.com/)
A. UI:
- Simple and well organize
B. UX:
- Booking section shows up by clicking, user can focus on it easier
- Destination menu displays list of country with related region, it helps visitor alot to find location
## 2. [VietJet](https://www.vietjetair.com/Sites/Web/vi-VN/Home)
A. UI:
- Too many things and information display when the page is too short
B. UX: 
- Look so messy, A visitor dont know where to focus on this page
- I think they might attend on promotions than another things because they're low-cost airline. So it's suitable for people who are looking for cheap flies.
- Does not support responsive on multi-platform
- Both arrival and departure fields doesn't have searching function for destination
## 3. [Jetstar](https://www.jetstar.com/vn/en/home)
A. UI:
- Good design with orange
- Like Vietjet they're low-cost airline but more organized with promotion banner
B. UX:
- The dropdown menu on arrival and departure field is too big.
- On departure destination field, it should get the correct location like Singaporean airline (currently it's from Hanoi)
## 4. [Singaporean Airline](http://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/vn/home)
A. UI:
- 3rd banner is a low quality image
- Banner doesn't look good on mobile size
B. UX:
- I dont like the static carousel, so i think it should be a auto-carousel.
- Automatically get the correct departure destination for customer, it's really helpful
- All information on banner for services not promotions. Seem good for somebody who are looking for high quality trips.
## 5. [Emirates](https://www.emirates.com/vn/english/)
A. UI:
- Fancy website
B. UX:
- Like Jetstar it should get the correct location on arrvial field
- Rating section for user experience, kinda cool
